- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.
- **Shadcn UI**: A UI component library for React applications with a focus on simplicity and consistency.
- **React Query**: A data fetching and caching library for React applications that provides a unified API for fetching data from various sources.
- **Redux Toolkit**: An opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development, including utilities for simplified setup, immutable state management, and more.
- **Zod**: A TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library for building structured data.
